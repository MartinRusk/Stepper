# Stepper MC
A sophisticated Stepper Motor Library with extensive Motion Control functions.

Stepper MC supports accelerations ramps with optimized timing due to minmum computational overhead, backlash handling and motion in engineering units.
Steppers can be configured either in unlimited, limited or modulo mode. Feed constant for units per turn can be set individually.
